# "Fan Remote"

A self-contained Rust binary to expose a single X10 command (turn off that fan)
as an HTML form button.

In its current form, it's highly specialized, but I've put so much work into
locking down the systemd sandboxing for it that you might find it useful as a
starting point for creating ultra-sandboxed HTTP daemons that need to invoke
`/usr/bin/br` or something similar.

Here's what `systemd-analyze security` has to say about it as of this writing:

The `✗ ProtectClock=` isn't intended, but I haven't been able to figure out what
else in the service definition is overriding my `ProtectClock=yes`.

## Reference Materials

If you'd like to make your own systemd services more secure, here are the
resources I used:

- [Writing a Secure Systemd Service with Sandboxing and Dynamic Users](https://nickb.dev/blog/writing-a-secure-systemd-service-with-sandboxing-and-dynamic-users)
- [security and hardening options for systemd service units](https://gist.github.com/ageis/f5595e59b1cddb1513d1b425a323db04)
- [Use TemporaryFileSystem to hide files or directories from systemd services](https://www.sherbers.de/use-temporaryfilesystem-to-hide-files-or-directories-from-systemd-services/)

I also mixed together these for how to do socket activation, since Rust services
start so quickly and systemd socket activation terminates the connection for
you, allowing the unit file to omit permission to use any network-related
syscalls:

- [The End of the Road: systemd’s “Socket” Units](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/end-road-systemds-socket-units/)
- [Systemd socket based activation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617031521/https://leonardoce.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/systemd-socket-based-activation/)
