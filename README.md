# "Fan Remote"

A self-contained Rust binary to expose a single X10 command (turn off that fan)
as an HTML form button.

In its current form, it's highly specialized, but I've put so much work into
locking down the systemd sandboxing for it that you might find it useful as a
starting point for creating ultra-sandboxed HTTP daemons that need to invoke
`/usr/bin/br` or something similar.

Here's what `systemd-analyze security` has to say about it as of this writing:

The `✗ ProtectClock=` isn't intended, but I haven't been able to figure out what
else in the service definition is overriding my `ProtectClock=yes`.
